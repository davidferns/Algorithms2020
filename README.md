#Description This repository contains the coursework which i have attempted and completed throughout the duration of the course. It is divided into packages based on the labs.

Lab1- Contains the implementation of the Russian Peasant's Algorithm. It contains a timer to time how long does it take for the completion of the algorithm.

lab3- Contains the implementation of a recursive fibonacci algorithm and compares it's time taken to complete with an iterative fibonacci algorithm. It also contains the algorithm to solve the tower of hanoi problem with various number of disks.

lab4- Contains the implementation of 3 sorting Algorithms;

Selection Sort
Insertion Sort
Bogo Sort 

These sorting algorithms are tested for various input sizes and compares which algorithm is most efficeint with the help of a timer.
lab5- Contains the implementation of the Merge Sort,insertion sort and the Enhanced Merge Sort algorithms and compares which is more efficient.

lab6- Implementation of the Quick Sort and the Enhanced Quick Sort algorithm.

lab7- Implementation of a BruteSearchAlgorithm and KMPSearch algorithm and compares which is more efficient.

lab8- Implementation of a trie data structure, containing the functionalite to insert and search an element.
